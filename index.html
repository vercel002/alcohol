              <td><p class="style11">It was a day during winter of 1998...</p>
                <p class="style11"> A few weeks before that  day, I had a minor traffic accident while I was driving after a 'few' drinks,  and my wife had now gotten very upset with my drinking...</p>
                <p class="style11">To avoid lengthy  arguments, as much as possible I was now drinking in secret. I'd gulp down a  glass before she woke up, while she was out shopping, while she was in the  shower, while she was in the other room helping our daughter with her homework…</p>
                <p class="style11"> At work, I also needed to drink without being noticed by my boss who had  already threatened to fire me three times, so I'd hide a bottle in the trash  can under my desk and take a quick swig when nobody was watching…</p>
                <p class="style11"> On this particular day of 1998, we were going to my  brother-in-law's for my nephew's 4th birthday party. That meant a  whole evening of socializing without any chance of drinking in privacy. I knew  I wouldn't be able to go through it sober, and that I'd have to booze up before going  there...</p>
                <p class="style11">Yet, my wife seemed to know what I was up to, and while we were  preparing to go, she kept me in her sight. Then, just before we headed out, she  went to use the lavatory…and I grabbed the opportunity...</p>
                <p class="style11"> I snatched a bottle of  gin from my "clothes drawer" and downed half of it…</p>
                <p class="style11">I felt alive and ready for  the party…</p>
                <p class="style11"> My brother-in-law lived just a 15 minute drive away so we  got there ok. I wasn't ok a few minutes later though, as I <strong>threw up without  warning in front of all of them</strong>...</p>
                <p class="style11"> I still remember clearly the look of disgust  on their faces, the horrified look on my nephew's face, …and my wife…I couldn't  even bring myself to look at her…</p>
                <p class="style25" align="center"> I Had Never Felt So Humiliated In My Life…</p>
                <p class="style11"><br>
                  Next morning, amid the guilt, humiliation and shame, I  realized that my drinking had gotten out of control and that I was on the brink  of destroying my life and my marriage. It was at the point that<strong> <u>I KNEW</u></strong> I had a  problem and had to do something about it…</p>
                <p class="style11"> Yet I did not want to go to AA because I didn't want to be  labelled an alcoholic…I just wanted a way to control my urges, <strong><u>STOP</u></strong><u> my  drinking</u>, and be able to live without alcohol.</p>
                <p class="style11"> And thus started the long, frustrating road of trial and  error, self-experimentation, several relapses, visits to doctors, life coaches,  naturopaths, and dozens of former addicts… until I finally pieced together a  complete and comprehensive method that allowed me to…<br>
                </p>
                <p class="style25" align="center">Quit Drinking, <u><em>For Good!</em></u><em></em></p>
                <p><br>
                  <span class="style11">I've now been sober for 11 years and I no longer feel any urge  to reach for the glass. </span></p>
                <p class="style11">No longer do I feel tempted when I'm in social  situations that involve alcohol, and I no longer need alcohol to be confident,  talk to people, and enjoy social situations…</p>
                <p class="style11"> When my day is hectic and stressful, I no longer feel the  need for a drink...</p>
                <p class="style11"> I no longer spend my money on alcohol, and I no longer wake  up with headaches and shame…</p>
                <p class="style11"> At the age of 47, I'm now feeling the healthiest I've ever  been, because I've stopped poisoning myself with alcohol...</p>
                <p class="style11"> Me and my wife have rekindled our love and my daughter now  has <u>a father she can look up to</u>.</p>
                <p class="style11"> I feel like I've been reborn. It's a great feeling. </p>
                <p class="style11"> And I was able to achieve this using a few simple secrets  that I now want to share with you...</p>
                <p class="style11"> I've created a step-by-step system to empower you to <strong>stop  drinking <u>TODAY</u></strong>. It works, simply-put, because I was in your exact same shoes  and I know exactly what works and <strong>what doesn't.</strong></p><strong>

                    <p class="testimonial-content">Dear Mark, me and my family will forever be grateful to you  for you have truly <u>saved my life</u>. First time I tried to quit was after I woke  up in hospital as a result of a drunken stupid fight. I talked to my doctor, he  referred me to an addiction counsellor, but even after a number of expensive  sessions I found myself back to my addiction. </p>
                    <p class="testimonial-content">Second time I tried to quit was  after I drove my fist through a glass window during an argument with my wife...I  needed 12 stiches in my forearm. This time I went to my local AA, but not being  a religious man I was turned off by their 'the-solution-is-in-god' approach. </p>
                    <p class="testimonial-content">Fast forward to three months ago, I crashed my car into an old couple's front  porch after a heavy night of drinking at the pub. Thankfully they weren't hurt,  but I suffered a concussion. The next day, I realized I really had a problem  and that it was time I got serious about quitting. </p>
                    <p class="testimonial-content">This time, I came across  your system and felt it was right for me. I'm so thankful I did as today is my  80th day sober and I never felt happier in my whole life!</p>

Your guide was  extremely eye-opening and the daily emails made it <u>extremely easy to quit and  to establish a routine that did not involve alcohol</u>. The first couple of days  were challenging but I was able to deal with the withdrawal symptoms using your  techniques and recommendations and every day after that I was desiring alcohol  less and less.

                Alcoholism is a broad term for problems with alcohol, and  is generally used to mean compulsive and uncontrolled consumption of alcoholic  beverages, usually to the detriment of the drinker's health, personal  relationships, and social standing. It is medically considered a disease,  specifically an addictive illness. In psychiatry several other terms have been  used, specifically “alcohol abuse”, “alcohol dependence”, and “alcohol use  disorder”.<br>

Current statistics shows that  some 30 percent of Americans have had a drinking problem or some form of  alcohol abuse in their past while a further 15 percent are active alcoholics.</p>
                <p class="style11" align="justify">Millions  of people suffer from alcoholism, and most of them don't even know it. Or  perhaps, they just don’t want to admit it to themselves. If you or somebody you  know is suffering from alcoholism, it is important to act immediately. The  effect of alcohol on the body and brain is significant. Alcohol abuse and  addiction are serious, potentially lethal conditions.<br>
